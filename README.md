# SpaceGame-Classic-

Overview
========
My original final project submission for CMPE-250 Assembly Language Programming. Made for Keil MKL46Z256 using mixed ARM Assembly/C. 
The LCD display code does not work in this version, but the score (which would normally be displayed on the LCD) is also
displayed on-screen and the game as a whole is fully functional regardless. To play, use a terminal emulator (e.g. PuTTY) and 
connect to the port which the microcontroller is connected to with a baud rate of 96000.
To move, hold the on-board touch slider in direction you want to move. To fire, use either on-board pushbutton.

I was originally going to work on a new version which would have added enemy swooping and fixed the LCD code (hence the subtitle "Classic"),
but I lost motivation to work on this.
